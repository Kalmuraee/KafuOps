# Implementation Status

This document maps every spec document in `docs/` and the product surface
described in `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` to its current implementation state.

The repository contains two layers:

- **`docs/` and `website/`** — the product specification. These describe what
  KafuOps is meant to be. Some are aspirational.
- **`src/`, `tests/`, `bin/`, `Dockerfile`, `deploy/`** — the actual
  implementation.

Use this table to understand what you can actually run today versus what is
still on the design board.

## Legend

- ✅ **Implemented** — works in `src/` and is covered by tests or smoke trials.
- 🟡 **Partial** — code path exists but has known limitations called out here.
- 🔲 **Not yet** — described in docs only; no code.

## PRODUCT_BRIEF MVP success criteria

| Criterion | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Connect to one Git provider (GitHub or GitLab) | 🟡 | `src/mr/github.ts`, `src/mr/gitlab.ts` open real PRs/MRs (and optionally auto-merge) once `KAFUOPS_GIT_TOKEN` and `repo.url` are set. Without them the pipeline runs end-to-end in dry-run. |
| Connect to one runtime source | ✅ | Wrapper mode (`kafuops run -- <cmd>`), the webhook server, an **OpenTelemetry OTLP receiver** (`POST /v1/otel/traces`), and **sidecar file tailing** (`agent start` tails `runtime.log_sources` of type `file`) are all implemented. |
| Build a project memory file tree and architecture summary | ✅ | `src/scanner/*`, `src/graph/*`. Route discovery covers Node/TS, Python, **Go, Java (Spring), and Rust**; the architecture graph parses imports for all of these. Memory at `.kafuops/memory/`. |
| Detect an error event and create an incident | ✅ | `src/incident/engine.ts` — fingerprint dedup, trigger policies, noise filters, rate limiting, plus a `force` path for manual/`simulate` incidents. |
| Select relevant files from stack traces and architecture graph | ✅ | `src/context/builder.ts` — top stack frame + graph neighbors + nearest tests; redacts and writes a grounding manifest. Now also consumes **real runtime logs** (ring-buffer excerpt persisted per incident) and prior-incident/review-feedback memory. |
| Call an LLM with a sanitized context bundle | ✅ | `src/llm/orchestrator.ts` — OpenAI + Anthropic. `trigger_mode` (`off`/`manual_only`/`incident_only`) is fully enforced via an `invocation` flag; `require_redaction` is a hard gate on live calls; `audit_model_context` and `structured_outputs` are honored. Every call audited. Without a key → deterministic dry-run. |
| Generate a small patch and regression test | 🟡 | Runs through the selected provider. A mocked-provider test proves the pipeline applies a generated diff and turns a failing test green (`tests/e2e-fix.test.ts`); real-provider fix *quality* still depends on the model. |
| Run tests in a sandbox | ✅ | Local sandbox (rsync copy → git snapshot → `git apply` → install + test) **and Docker** (`sandbox.type: docker`, falls back to local if no daemon). `targeted_test_command` runs a focused test for the changed test file before the full suite. |
| Open an MR/PR with evidence and confidence score | ✅ | `src/mr/creator.ts` body; GitHub via Octokit, GitLab via REST. `auto_create`/`auto_merge` are real knobs (`src/mr/decide.ts`); approval-required changes never auto-open. Dry-run without tokens. |

## docs/ map

| Doc | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | ✅ | Components match `src/`. Sidecar now observes both webhooks and tailed log files. |
| `ARCHITECTURE_GRAPH.md` | ✅ | `src/graph/builder.ts` builds JSON + a richer Markdown (routes→handler, external packages, tested files). |
| `BLAST_RADIUS.md` | ✅ | `src/blast-radius/index.ts`. |
| `CLI.md` | ✅ | All commands exist. `policies explain` now supports `--incident <id>` as well as `--file`. |
| `CONFIDENCE_SCORE.md` | ✅ | `src/confidence/score.ts`. |
| `CONFIGURATION.md` | ✅ | Zod schema in `src/config/schema.ts`; reserved/advisory fields are annotated in-schema. |
| `DATA_MODEL.md` | ✅ | Types in `src/types/index.ts`. |
| `DEPLOYMENT_DOCKER.md` | ✅ | `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.example.yml`. `KAFUOPS_CONFIG` is now honored by the loader. |
| `DEPLOYMENT_KUBERNETES.md` | 🟡 | `deploy/kubernetes/` manifests + `deploy/helm/kafuops/` chart (agent + worker). A first-class operator/CRD is still on the roadmap. |
| `ERROR_TRIGGERED_LLM.md` | ✅ | Four-stage orchestrator. |
| `EXAMPLE_INCIDENT_PACKET.md` | ✅ | Matches `context-bundle.json`. |
| `EXAMPLES.md` | 🟡 | `examples/sample-app/` exists; further worked examples are aspirational. |
| `FAQ.md` | 🟡 | Partly marketing copy; treat as roadmap context. |
| `GETTING_STARTED.md` | ✅ | Works end-to-end with `--in-place --dry-run`. |
| `GLOSSARY.md` | ✅ | Reference doc. |
| `INCIDENT_WORKFLOW.md` | ✅ | Lifecycle matches `IncidentStore` statuses + CLI (incl. `mark-merged`/`mark-rejected`). |
| `INDEX.md` | ✅ | Doc index. |
| `INTEGRATIONS.md` | ✅ | Sentry/Datadog (HMAC), Alertmanager (bearer), generic JSON, and OpenTelemetry OTLP are all implemented at the intake layer. |
| `MR_GENERATION.md` | ✅ | Body template + labels match `src/mr/creator.ts`. |
| `OBSERVABILITY_LAYER.md` | ✅ | Ring buffer, normalization, dedup, **plus the OTLP receiver**. Ring-buffer excerpts are persisted per incident and fed to the model. |
| `POLICIES.md` | ✅ | `src/policies/engine.ts`; pre- and post-apply checks; `policies explain --incident`. |
| `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` | ✅ | File-tree/routes/services/tests/deps generated by `scan`; per-incident memory (`incidents.md`) and review-feedback (`review-feedback.md`) are now written and fed back into context. |
| `PROMPT_INJECTION_SAFETY.md` | 🟡 | Untrusted-data wrapping + contract tests (`tests/prompt-injection.test.ts`); not yet adversarially fuzzed. |
| `REDACTION.md` | ✅ | Built-in patterns + JSON-field scrubbing + ReDoS guard. Applied at every intake (incl. the manual `/v1/incidents` endpoint) and before every model call. |
| `ROADMAP.md` | 🟡 | Read alongside this file. |
| `RUNTIME_MODES.md` | ✅ | Wrapper, webhook, and sidecar (webhook + file tailing) all work. Kubernetes via `deploy/`. A minimal embedded Node SDK (`installErrorReporter`) is now included — see `docs/NODE_SDK.md`. |
| `SECURITY_PRIVACY.md` | ✅ | Redaction, audit logging, never_modify policy, HMAC + bearer webhook auth, require_redaction gate. |
| `SELF_HOSTING.md` | ✅ | Docker compose + Helm chart + raw K8s manifests. |
| `SETUP_WIZARD.md` | ✅ | `kafuops init`. |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | ✅ | Reference doc; `policies explain --incident` now exists. |

## Larger gaps still open

Not blocking, but worth knowing about:

- **Real-provider fix quality** isn't benchmarked — the pipeline is proven
  end-to-end with a mocked provider (`tests/e2e-fix.test.ts`), but how good the
  actual LLM patches are on real bugs depends on the model and isn't measured here.
- **Agent dedup state is per-process** — run a single agent replica (the
  manifests pin `replicas: 1`). The *worker* is concurrency-safe via incident
  claiming, but the agent's in-memory rate/repeat windows are not shared.
- **Prompt-injection** has contract tests but is not adversarially fuzzed.
- **OTLP is JSON-only** (protobuf bodies are rejected with a clear 415).
- **Deploy-diff awareness / recurrence detection** (rest of roadmap phase 4) are
  not implemented. Similar-incident matching *is* now done (related incidents are
  retrieved into context), but without embeddings/vector search.
- **A first-class Kubernetes operator/CRD is deliberately deferred.** The Helm
  chart + manifests in `deploy/` already cover deployment; a controller-runtime
  operator is a separate project, not a robustness gap. The embedded SDK ships as
  a minimal in-package module (`kafuops` / `docs/NODE_SDK.md`), not a separate
  `@kafuops/node` package.

If you find a gap that isn't listed here, that's a real bug — please open an
issue.
